# Capstone_Final_Report: Unveiling Zurich's Canine Community

## Introduction
This report presents the findings from a data-driven exploration of the dog population in Zurich. The project aimed to understand the trends in dog ownership, preferences, and demographics. This exploration is particularly valuable for pet-related businesses, city planners, and dog lovers in Zurich.

### Problem Statement
The primary objective was to analyze the characteristics and trends of dog ownership in Zurich. Key questions included identifying the most popular dog breeds, understanding the age distribution of dog owners, and exploring the geographic distribution of dogs across the city's districts.

## Methodology
The analysis was based on datasets from Kaggle, covering the years 2015 to 2017. These datasets included details about dog owners and breeds. The methodology involved data cleaning, merging datasets, and performing exploratory data analysis using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

## Findings and Discussion
* **Gender Distribution:** There is almost an equal distribution of male and female dogs in Zurich, with a slight predominance of females.
* **Age Distribution of Dog Owners:** The majority of dog owners are in the 40-59 age bracket, indicating a trend towards middle-aged individuals being more inclined towards dog ownership.
* **Breed Popularity:** Mixed breeds, especially 'Mischling Klein' (small mixed breed), along with Chihuahua and Labrador Retriever, are the most popular in Zurich.
* **Color Preferences:** The most common colors for dogs are black, brown, and white.
Geographic Distribution: Dog ownership varies significantly across city districts, with District 9 having the highest number of dog owners.

### Recommendations
* **Targeted Marketing for Pet Businesses:** Pet-related businesses can target their products and services towards popular breeds and focus on the most common dog colors.
* **Community Planning:** City planners could use these insights to create or improve dog-friendly spaces in districts with higher dog ownership.
* **Age-Specific Services:** Veterinary clinics and pet care services can tailor their offerings to cater to the needs of the most common age groups of dog owners.

## Conclusion
This project successfully provides a comprehensive overview of Zurich's canine community, offering actionable insights for various stakeholders. The findings highlight the importance of understanding pet demographics in urban planning and business strategies.
